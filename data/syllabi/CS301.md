## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to machine learning, covering both theoretical foundations and practical applications. Students will learn the fundamental algorithms and techniques used to build systems that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions.

The course bridges the gap between mathematical theory and real-world implementation. Students will gain hands-on experience with popular machine learning libraries (scikit-learn, pandas, numpy) while developing a deep understanding of the underlying algorithms.

Machine learning is transforming industries from healthcare to finance to transportation. This course prepares students for advanced study in AI/ML and for careers in data science and machine learning engineering.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the mathematical foundations of machine learning algorithms

- Implement and apply unsupervised learning algorithms (clustering, dimensionality reduction)
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics
- Handle real-world data preprocessing challenges
- Select appropriate algorithms for different problem types
- Avoid common pitfalls like overfitting and data leakage
