## Course Information
- **Course Code:** CS101
- **Credits:** 3
- **Prerequisites:** None
- **Instructor:** Dr. Sarah Chen

- **Semester:** Fall/Spring (offered every semester)

## Course Description

This foundational course introduces students to the fundamental concepts of computer programming using Python. Students will learn to think computationally and develop problem-solving skills through hands-on coding exercises. No prior programming experience is required.

The course emphasizes practical application, with students completing weekly programming assignments that build progressively in complexity. By the end of the course, students will be able to write programs that solve real-world problems, manipulate data, and create simple applications.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Write, debug, and test Python programs
- Apply fundamental programming constructs (variables, loops, conditionals, functions)
- Work with basic data structures (lists, dictionaries, strings)
- Read and understand code written by others
- Break down complex problems into smaller, manageable components
- Follow best practices for code organization and documentation

## Topics Covered

### Module 1: Getting Started (Weeks 1-2)

### Module 2: Control Flow (Weeks 3-4)
- Conditional statements (if, elif, else)
- Boolean logic and comparison operators
- While loops and for loops
- Loop control (break, continue)

### Module 3: Functions (Weeks 5-6)
- Defining and calling functions
- Parameters and return values
- Scope and lifetime of variables
- Built-in functions and modules

### Module 4: Data Structures (Weeks 7-9)
