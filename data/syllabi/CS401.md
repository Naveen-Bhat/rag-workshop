## Course Description

This advanced course provides an in-depth exploration of deep learning, the subset of machine learning that has revolutionized artificial intelligence. Students will study neural network architectures, training techniques, and applications across computer vision, natural language processing, and generative AI.

Building on the machine learning foundations from CS301, this course dives deep into the theory and practice of neural networks. Students will implement networks from scratch to understand the fundamentals, then leverage modern frameworks (PyTorch) for real-world applications.

Deep learning powers many of today's most impressive AI systems: image recognition, language models, autonomous vehicles, and more. This course prepares students for research and industry roles in AI.
