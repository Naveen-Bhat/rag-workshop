- **Credits:** 3
- **Prerequisites:** MATH101 (Calculus I)
- **Instructor:** Dr. Maria Gonzalez

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive introduction to probability theory and statistical methods. Students will learn to collect, analyze, and interpret data using statistical techniques. The course covers both descriptive and inferential statistics, with emphasis on practical applications.

In today's data-driven world, statistical literacy is essential. This course provides the foundation for making informed decisions based on data, understanding research findings, and applying quantitative methods across disciplines.

The course balances theoretical foundations with hands-on data analysis. Students will work with real datasets and learn to use statistical software for analysis.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Describe data using summary statistics and visualizations
- Understand and apply probability concepts
- Work with common probability distributions
- Perform hypothesis tests and construct confidence intervals
- Apply regression analysis to model relationships
- Critically evaluate statistical claims

## Topics Covered

### Module 1: Descriptive Statistics (Weeks 1-2)
- Types of data and measurement scales
- Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode)
- Measures of spread (variance, standard deviation, IQR)
- Data visualization (histograms, boxplots, scatterplots)

### Module 2: Probability Foundations (Weeks 3-4)
- Basic probability concepts
- Conditional probability and Bayes' theorem
- Independence
- Combinatorics basics

### Module 3: Random Variables and Distributions (Weeks 5-7)
- Discrete random variables
- Binomial distribution
- Poisson distribution
- Continuous random variables
- Normal distribution
- Central Limit Theorem

### Module 4: Sampling and Estimation (Week 8)
- Sampling methods
- Sampling distributions
- Point estimation
- Confidence intervals

### Module 5: Hypothesis Testing (Weeks 9-11)
- Null and alternative hypotheses
- Type I and Type II errors
- One-sample and two-sample t-tests
- Chi-square tests
- P-values and statistical significance

### Module 6: Regression Analysis (Weeks 12-13)
- Correlation
- Simple linear regression
- Interpretation of regression output
- Prediction and residual analysis

### Module 7: Applications and Review (Week 14)
- Multiple regression overview
- Applications in research
- Common statistical fallacies
- Final exam preparation

## Textbook

**Required:** "Statistics" by Freedman, Pisani, and Purves (4th Edition)

**Software:** Students will use Python (with pandas and scipy) or R for data analysis labs.

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Homework (weekly) | 20% |
| Lab Assignments (5) | 20% |
| Midterm Exam | 25% |
| Final Exam | 30% |
| Participation | 5% |

## Lab Sessions

Weekly lab sessions introduce statistical software and provide hands-on practice with data analysis. Attendance is mandatory.

## Relevance to Other Fields

This course is required or recommended for:
- **Machine Learning (CS301):** Statistical foundations for ML
- **Data Science:** Core statistical skills
- **Social Sciences:** Research methods
- **Business:** Analytics and decision-making
- **Health Sciences:** Biostatistics foundations

## Academic Integrity

Statistical analyses must be your own work. While collaboration on concepts is encouraged, submitted lab reports and homework must be individual efforts. Copying code or analyses is a violation of academic integrity.
