## Course Description

This course covers the fundamental concepts of single-variable calculus, including limits, derivatives, and integrals. Students will develop mathematical reasoning skills and learn to apply calculus to solve problems in science, engineering, and other fields.

Calculus is the mathematical language of change and is essential for understanding the physical world. This course provides the foundation for further study in mathematics, physics, engineering, economics, and many other disciplines.

The course emphasizes both conceptual understanding and computational proficiency. Students will learn not just how to calculate derivatives and integrals, but why these operations are meaningful and how to apply them.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand the concept of a limit and evaluate limits
- Compute derivatives using various rules and techniques
- Apply derivatives to solve optimization and related rates problems
- Understand the relationship between derivatives and integrals (Fundamental Theorem)
- Evaluate definite and indefinite integrals
- Apply integration to calculate areas and solve applied problems

## Course Policies

- **Homework:** Assigned weekly, due at the beginning of class. Collaboration is encouraged, but write-ups must be individual.
- **Calculators:** Scientific calculators are permitted, but graphing calculators are not allowed on exams.
- **Tutoring:** Free tutoring is available at the Math Learning Center, open daily.

## Recitation Sessions

Weekly 1-hour recitation sessions are required. These small-group sessions provide additional practice and are led by teaching assistants.

## Study Tips

- Practice problems daily, not just before exams
- Form study groups to discuss challenging concepts
- Attend office hours early and often
- Review prerequisite algebra skills if needed
