## Course Information
- **Course Code:** CS201
- **Credits:** 4
- **Prerequisites:** CS101 (Introduction to Programming)
- **Instructor:** Prof. Michael Torres
- **Office:** Engineering Building, Room 415

## Course Description

This course provides a comprehensive study of fundamental data structures and algorithms that form the backbone of computer science. Students will learn to analyze, design, and implement efficient solutions to computational problems. The course combines theoretical analysis with practical implementation in Python.

Building on the programming foundations from CS101, this course takes students deeper into how data is organized, stored, and manipulated efficiently. Understanding these concepts is essential for success in advanced computer science courses and professional software development.

## Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Implement and use fundamental data structures (arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, graphs, hash tables)
- Analyze algorithm efficiency using Big-O notation
- Apply appropriate data structures to solve specific problems
- Implement and analyze sorting and searching algorithms
- Design recursive solutions to problems
- Understand trade-offs between different data structure choices

## Grading

| Component | Weight |
|-----------|--------|
| Programming Assignments (6) | 35% |
| Midterm Exam | 20% |
| Final Exam | 25% |
| Lab Exercises | 15% |
| Class Participation | 5% |

## Course Policies

- **Programming Assignments:** Must be submitted via the course portal. All code must compile and run without errors.
- **Collaboration:** You may discuss concepts with classmates, but all code must be written individually.
- **Late Policy:** 20% penalty per day, maximum 2 days late.

## Lab Sessions

Weekly 2-hour lab sessions are mandatory. Labs provide hands-on practice implementing the data structures discussed in lecture.
